# Flappy-Bird--Game
I've developed a Flappy Bird game using Java. The game follows the classic Flappy Bird gameplay, where the player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of obstacles by tapping the screen or pressing a key to make the bird flap its wings and fly upward. The objective is to pass through gaps between pipes or obstacles without colliding with them.

The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) with colorful graphics for the bird, pipes, and background. It includes animations for the bird's flight and collision effects when the bird hits an obstacle. The game also tracks the player's score based on the number of obstacles successfully passed.

I implemented game mechanics such as gravity to simulate the bird's flight physics, collision detection to detect when the bird hits an obstacle, and score tracking logic to update the player's score in real-time. Overall, it's a fun and challenging game that demonstrates my Java programming skills in game development.
